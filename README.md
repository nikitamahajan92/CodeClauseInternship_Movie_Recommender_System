# CodeClauseInternship_Movie_Recommender_System
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System project repository! This project focuses on developing a recommendation engine that suggests personalized movie recommendations based on users' preferences and historical data. Whether you're a movie enthusiast or just looking for something new to watch, our recommender system aims to enhance your movie-watching experience.

# Project Overview
In this project, we dive into the world of recommendation algorithms to create a movie recommender system. By leveraging user ratings, movie metadata, and collaborative filtering techniques, we aim to provide users with tailored movie suggestions. The goal is to help users discover new movies that align with their tastes and preferences.

# Key Features
Data Collection: Acquire movie data, including user ratings, movie details, and potentially genre information, to build a comprehensive recommendation dataset.
Recommendation Algorithms: Implement various recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and potentially hybrid approaches, to generate movie recommendations.
User Interaction: Develop a user-friendly interface where users can input their preferences and receive personalized movie suggestions.
Evaluation Metrics: Use appropriate evaluation metrics, such as precision at K and mean average precision, to assess the quality of the recommendation system.
Visualization: Create visualizations to showcase the distribution of ratings, popular genres, and the performance of the recommendation algorithms.
